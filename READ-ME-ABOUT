- RiverPod :
  - is incredebly powerful in handling the state 
  -however why i chose is cuz the way it handls the : 
    - ASYNC STATE AND ASYNC CRUD 
    - all the complixity is in the riverpod so the UI (CONSUMER) will be incredebli simple even when the use of ASYNCRO
   
   
- One Stupid Mistake to avoid :
  - if u somehow needed the previous to create the new one remember to clone it first before cleaning the old state and now in the creation of a new state u have a clone of 
  previous one ( ex : cloning an array to add new elements to it ...etc)
